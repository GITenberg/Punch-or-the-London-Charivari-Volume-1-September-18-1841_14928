<h2>THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<h4>HAS A GREAT DEAL TO SAY ABOUT SOME ONE ELSE BESIDES OUR
HERO.</h4>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/010-01.png"><img src=
"images/010-01.png" alt="DESCRIPTION" id="img010-01" name=
"img010-01" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">K</span>indness was a characteristic of
Agamemnon&rsquo;s disposition, and it is not therefore a matter of
surprise that &ldquo;the month&rdquo;&mdash;<em>the</em> month,
<em>par excellence</em>, of &ldquo;all the months i&rsquo;the
kalendar&rdquo;&mdash;produced a succession of those annoyances
which, in the best regulated families, are certain to be partially
experienced by the masculine progenitor. O, bachelors! be warned in
time; let not love link you to his flowery traces and draw you into
the temple of Hymen! Be not deluded by the glowing fallacies of
Anacreon and Boccaccio, but remember that they were bachelors.
There is nothing exhilarating in caudle, nor enchanting in
Kensington-gardens, when you are converted into a light porter of
children. We have been married, and are now seventy-one, and wear a
&ldquo;brown George;&rdquo; consequently, we have experience and
cool blood in our veins&mdash;two excellent auxiliaries in the
formation of a correct judgment in all matters connected with the
heart.</p>
<p>Our pen must have been the pinion of a wild goose, or why these
continued digressions?</p>
<p>Agamemnon&rsquo;s troubles commenced with the first cough of
Mrs. Pilcher on the door-mat. Mrs. P. was the monthly nurse, and
monthly nurses always have a short cough. Whether this phenomenon
arises from the obesity consequent upon arm-chairs and good living,
or from an habitual intimation that they are present, and have not
received half-a-crown, or a systematic declaration that the throat
is dry, and would not object to a gargle of gin, and perhaps a
little water, or&mdash;but there is no use hunting conjecture, when
you are all but certain of not catching it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pilcher was &ldquo;the moral of a nurse;&rdquo; she was
about forty-eight and had, according to her own account,
&ldquo;been the mother of eighteen lovely babes, born in
wedlock,&rdquo; though her most intimate friends had never been
introduced to more than one young gentleman, with a nose like a
wart, and hair like a scrubbing-brush. When he made his
<em>debut</em>, he was attired in a suit of blue drugget, with the
pewter order of the parish of St. Clement on his bosom; and rumour
declared that he owed his origin to half-a-crown a week, paid every
Saturday. Mrs. Pilcher weighed about thirteen stone, including her
bundle, and a pint medicine-bottle, which latter article she
invariably carried in her dexter pocket, filled with a strong
tincture of juniper berries, and extract of cloves. This mixture
had been prescribed to her for what she called a
&ldquo;sinkingness,&rdquo; which afflicted her about 10 A.M., 11
A.M. (dinner), 2 P.M., 3 P.M. 4 P.M. 5 P.M. (tea), 7 P.M., 8 P.M.
(supper), 10 P.M., and at uncertain intervals during the night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pilcher was a martyr to a delicate appetite, for she could
never &ldquo;make nothing of a breakfast if she warn&rsquo;t coaxed
with a Yarmouth bloater, a rasher of ham, or a little bit of steak
done with the gravy in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her luncheon was obliged to be a mutton-chop, or a grilled bone,
and a pint of porter, bread and cheese having the effect of
rendering her &ldquo;as cross as two sticks, and as sour as
werjuice.&rdquo; Her dinner, and its satellites, tea and supper,
were all required to be hot, strong, and comfortable. A peculiar
hallucination under which she laboured is worthy of remark. When
eating, it was always her declared conviction that she <em>never
drank anything</em>, and when detected coquetting with a pint pot
or a tumbler, she was equally assured that she never <em>did eat
anything after her breakfast</em>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pilcher&rsquo;s duties never permitted her to take anything
resembling continuous rest; she had therefore another prescription
for an hour&rsquo;s doze after dinner. Mrs. Pilcher was also
troubled with a stiffness of the knee-joints, which never allowed
her to wait upon herself.</p>
<p>When this amiable creature had deposited herself in
Collumpsion&rsquo;s old easy-chair, and, with her bundle on her
knees, gasped out her first inquiry&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hopes all&rsquo;s as well as can be
expected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heart of <em>Pater</em> Collumpsion trembled in his bosom,
for he felt that to this incongruous mass was to be confided the
first blossom of his wedded love; and that for one month the
dynasty of 24, Pleasant-terrace was transferred from his hands to
that of Mrs. Waddledot, his wife&rsquo;s mother, and Mrs. Pilcher,
the monthly nurse. There was a short struggle for supremacy between
the two latter personages; but an angry appeal having been made to
Mrs. Applebite, by the lady, &ldquo;who had <em>nussed</em> the
first families in this land, and, in course, know&rsquo;d her
business,&rdquo; Mrs. Waddledot was forced to yield to Mrs.
Pilcher&rsquo;s bundle in <em>transitu</em>, and Mrs.
Applebite&rsquo;s hysterics in perspective.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pilcher was a nursery Macauley, and had the faculty of
discovering latent beauties in very small infants, that none but
doting parents ever believed. Agamemnon was an early convert to her
avowed opinions of the heir of Applebite, who, like all other heirs
of the same age, resembled a black boy boiled&mdash;that is, if
there is any affinity between lobsters and niggers. This peculiar
style of eloquence rendered her other eccentricities less
objectionable; and when, upon one occasion, the mixture of juniper
and cloves had disordered her head, instead of comforting her
stomachic regions, she excused herself by solemnly declaring, that
&ldquo;the brilliancy of the little darling&rsquo;s eyes, and his
intoxicating manners, had made her feel as giddy as a goose.&rdquo;
Collumpsion and Theresa both declared her discernment was equal to
her caudle, of which, by-the-bye, she was an excellent concocter
and consumer.</p>
<p>Old John and the rest of the servants, however, had no parental
string at which Mrs. Pilcher could tug, and the consequence was,
that they decided that she was an insufferable bore. Old John, in
particular, felt the ill effects of the heir of Applebite&rsquo;s
appearance in the family, and to such a degree did they interfere
with his old comforts, without increasing his pecuniary resources,
that he determined one morning, when taking up his master&rsquo;s
shaving water, absolutely to give warning; for what with the
morning calls, and continual ringing for glasses&mdash;the
perpetual communication kept up between the laundry-maid and the
mangle, and of which he was the circulating medium&mdash;the
insolence of the nurse, who had ordered him to carry five
soiled&mdash;never mind&mdash;down stairs: all these annoyances
combined, the old servant declared were too much for him.</p>
<p>Collumpsion laid his hand on John&rsquo;s shoulder, and pointing
to some of the little evidences of paternity which had found their
way even into his dormitory, said, &ldquo;John, think what I
suffer; do not leave me; I&rsquo;ll raise your wages, and engage a
boy to help you; but you are the only thing that reminds me of my
happy bachelorhood&mdash;you are the only one that can feel
a&mdash;feel a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Caudle</em> regard,&rdquo; interrupted John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle be &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; The &ldquo;rest is
silence,&rdquo; for at that moment Mrs. Waddledot entered the room,
gave a short scream, and went out again.</p>
<p>The month passed, and a hackney-coach, containing a bundle and
the respectable Mrs. Pilcher, &amp;c., rumbled from the door of No.
24, to the infinite delight of old John the footman, Betty the
housemaid, Esther the nurserymaid, Susan the cook, and Agamemnon
Collumpsion Applebite the proprietor.</p>
<p>How transitory is earthly happiness! How certain its
uncertainty! A little week had passed, and the &ldquo;Heir of
Applebite&rdquo; gave notice of his intention to come into his
property during an early minority, for his once happy progenitor
began to entertain serious intentions of employing a
coroner&rsquo;s jury to sit upon himself, owing to the incessant
and &ldquo;ear-piercing pipe&rdquo; of his little cherub. Vainly
did he bury his head beneath the pillow, until he was suffused with
perspiration&mdash;the cry reached him there and then. Cold air was
pumped into the bed by Mrs. Applebite, as she rocked to and fro, in
the hope of quieting the &ldquo;son of the sleepless.&rdquo;
Collumpsion was in constant communication with the
dressing-table&mdash;now for moist-sugar to stay the
hiccough&mdash;then for dill-water to allay the stomach-ache. To
save his little cherub from convulsions, twice was he converted
into a night-patrole, with the thermometer below zero&mdash;a bad
fire, with a large slate in it, and an empty coal-scuttle.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SURREY ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Variety,&rdquo; say our school copy-books, &ldquo;is
charming;&rdquo; hence this must be the most charming place of
amusement in London. The annexed list of entertainments was
produced on Tuesday last, when were added to the usual
<em>passe-temps</em>, a flower and fruit show. Wild beasts in
cages; flowers of all colours and sizes in pots; enormous cabbages;
Brobdignag apples; immense sticks of rhubarb; a view of Rome; a
brass band; a grand Roman cavalcade passing over the bridge of St.
Angelo; a deafening park of artillery, and an enchanting series of
pyrotechnic wonders, such as catherine-wheels, flower-pots, and
rockets; an illumination of St. Peter&rsquo;s; blazes of blue-fire,
showers of steel-filings, and a grand blow up of the castle of St.
Angelo.</p>
<p>Such are the entertainments provided by the proprietor. The
company&mdash;which numbered at least from five to six
thousand&mdash;gave them even greater variety. Numerous pic-nic
parties were seated about on the grass; sandwiches, bottled stout,
and (with reverence be it spoken) more potent liquors seemed to be
highly relished, especially by the ladies. Ices were sold at a
pastry-cook&rsquo;s stall, where a continued <em>feu-de-joie</em>
of ginger-pop was kept up during the whole afternoon and evening.
In short, the scene was one of complete <em>al fresco</em>
enjoyment; how could it be otherwise? The flowers delighted the
eye; Mr. Godfrey&rsquo;s well-trained band (to wit,
Beethoven&rsquo;s symphony in C minor, with all the fiddle passages
beautifully executed upon clarionets!) charmed the ear; and the
edibles and drinkables aforesaid the palate. Under such a press of
agreeables, the Surrey Zoological Gardens well deserve the name of
an Englishman&rsquo;s paradise.</p>

<h2>ON THE SCIENCE OF ELECTIONEERING.</h2>
<p>To the progress of science and the rapid march of moral
improvement the most effectual spur that has ever been applied was
the Reform Bill. Before the introduction of that measure,
electioneering was a simple process, hardly deserving the name of
an art; it has now arrived at the rank of a science, the great
beauty of which is, that, although complicated in practice, it is
most easy of acquirement. Under the old system boroughs were bought
by wholesale, scot and lot; now the traffic is done by retail.
Formerly there was but one seller; at present there must be some
thousands at least&mdash;all to be bargained with, all to be
bought. Thus the &ldquo;agency&rdquo; business of electioneering
has wonderfully increased, and so have the expenses.</p>
<p>In fact, an agent is to an election what the main-spring is to a
watch; he is, in point of fact, the real returning-officer. His
importance is not less than the talents and tact he is obliged to
exert. He must take a variety of shapes, must tell a variety of
lies, and perform the part of an animated contradiction. He must
benevolently pay the taxes of one man who can&rsquo;t vote while in
arrear; and cruelly serve notices of ejectment upon another, though
he can show his last quarter&rsquo;s receipt&mdash;he must attend
temperance meetings, and make opposition electors too drunk to
vote. He must shake hands with his greatest enemy, and
<em>palm</em> off upon him lasting proofs of friendship, and
silver-paper hints which way to vote. He must make flaming speeches
about principle, puns about &ldquo;interest,&rdquo; and promises
concerning everything, to everybody. He must never give less than
five pounds for being shorn by an honest and independent voter, who
never shaves for less than two-pence&mdash;nor under ten, for a
four-and-ninepenny goss to an uncompromising hatter. He must
present ear-rings to wives, bracelets to daughters, and be
continually broaching a hogshead for fathers, husbands, and
brothers. He must get up fancy balls, and give away fancy dresses
to ladies whom he fancies&mdash;especially if they fancy his
candidate, and their husbands fancy them. He must plan charities,
organise mobs, causing free-schools to be knocked up, and opponents
to be knocked down. Finally, he must do all these acts, and spend
all these sums purely for the good of his country; for, although a
select committee of the house tries the validity of the
election&mdash;though they prove bribery, intimidation, and
treating to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction, yet they always find
out that the candidate has had nothing to do with it&mdash;that the
agent is not <em>his</em> agent, but has acted solely on patriotic
grounds; by which he is often so completely a martyr, that he is,
after all, actually prosecuted for bribery, by order of the very
house which he has helped to fill, and by the very man (as a part
of the parliament) he has himself returned.</p>
<p>That this great character might not be lost to posterity, we
furnish our readers with the portrait of</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/010-02.png"><img src=

<p>AN ELECTION AGENT.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h3>THE STATISTICAL SOCIETY.</h3>
<p>This useful society will shortly publish its Report; and, though
we have not seen it, we are enabled to guess with tolerable
accuracy what will be the contents of it:</p>
<p>In the first place, we shall be told the number of pins picked
up in the course of the day, by a person walking over a space of
fifteen miles round London, with the number of those not picked up;
an estimate of the class of persons that have probably dropped
them, with the use they were being put to when they actually fell;
and how they have been applied afterwards.</p>
<p>The Report will also put the public in possession of the number
of pot-boys employed in London; what is the average number of pots
they carry out; and what is the gross weight of metal in the pots
brought back again. This interesting head will include a
calculation of how much beer is consumed by children who are sent
to fetch it in jugs; and what is the whole amount of malt liquor,
the value of which reaches the producer&rsquo;s pocket, while the
mouth of the consumer, and not that of the party paying for it,
receives the sole benefit.</p>
<p>There are also to be published with the Report elaborate tables,
showing how many quarts of milk are spilt in the course of a year
in serving customers; what proportion of water it contains; and
what are the average ages and breed of the dogs who lap it up; and
how much is left unlapped up to be absorbed in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>When this valuable Report is published, we shall make copious
extracts.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A NOVEL ENTERTAINMENT.</h3>
<h4>DRURY-LANE THEATRE.</h4>
<p>Novelty is certainly the order of the day. Anything that does
not deviate from the old beaten track meets with little
encouragement from the present race of amusement-seekers, and,
consequently, does not pay the <em>entrepreneur</em>. Nudity in
public adds fresh charms to the orchestra, and red-fire and
crackers have become absolutely essential to harmony. Acting upon
this principle, Signor Venafra <em>gave</em> (we admire the term) a
fancy dress ball at Drury-lane Theatre on Monday evening last, upon
a plan hitherto unknown in England, but possibly, like the majority
of deceptive delusions now so popular, of continental origin. The
whole of the evening&rsquo;s entertainment took place in cabs and
hackney-coaches, and those vehicles performed several perfectly new
and intricate figures in Brydges-street, and the other
thoroughfares adjoining the theatres. The music provided for the
occasion appeared to be an organ-piano, which performed incessantly
at the corner of Bow-street, during the evening. Most of the
<em>&eacute;lite</em> of Hart-street and St. Giles&rsquo;s graced
the animated pavement as spectators. So perfectly successful was
the whole affair&mdash;on the word of laughing hundreds who came
away saying they had never been so amused in their lives&mdash;that
we hear it is in agitation never to attempt anything of the kind
again.</p>
<hr />
<h3>DONE AGAIN.</h3>
<p>Dunn, the bailless barrister, complained to his friend Charles
Phillips, that upon the last occasion he had the happiness of
meeting Miss Burdett Coutts on the Marine Parade, notwithstanding
all he has gone through for her, she would not condescend to take
the slightest notice of him. So far from offering anything in the
shape of consolation, the witty barrister remarked, &ldquo;Upon my
soul, her conduct was in perfect keeping with her situation, for
what on earth could be more in unison with a sea-view than</p>

<p>A CUTTER ON THE BEACH?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>It is well known that the piers of Westminster Bridge have
considerably sunk since their first erection. They are not the only
peers, in the same neighbourhood that have become lowered in the
position they once occupied.</p>

<h2>ASSERTION OF THE UNINTELLIGIBLE.</h2>
<h3>OR, &ldquo;A KANTITE&rsquo;S&rdquo; FLIGHTS AT AN
EXORDIUM.</h3>
<h4>FLIGHT THE FIRST.</h4>
<p>He who widely, yet ascensively, expatiates in those
in-all-ways-sloping fields of metaphysical investigation which
perplex whilst they captivate, and bewilder whilst they allure,
cannot evitate the perception of perception&rsquo;s fallibility,
nor avoid the conclusion (if that can be called a conclusion to
which, it may be said, there are no premises extant) that the
external senses are but deceptive <em>media</em> of interior mental
communication. It behoves the ardent, youthful explorator,
therefore, to &mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<h4>FLIGHT THE SECOND.</h4>
<p>In the Promethean persecutions which assail the insurgent
mentalities of the youth and morning vigour of the inexpressible
human soul, when, flushed with &AElig;olian light, and, as it were,
beaded with those lustrous dews which the eternal Aurora lets fall
from her melodious lip; if it escape living from the beak of the
vulture (no fable here!), then, indeed, it may aspire to
&mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<h4>FLIGHT THE THIRD.</h4>
<p>If, with waxen Icarian wing, we seek to ascend to that skiey
elevation whence only can the understretching regions of an
impassive mutability be satisfactorily contemplated; and if, in our
heterogeneous ambition, aspirant above self-capacity, we approach
too near the flammiferous Titan, and so become pinionless, and
reduced again to an earthly prostration, what marvel is it, that
&mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<h4>FLIGHT THE FOURTH.</h4>
<p>When the perennial Faustus, ever-resident in the questioning
spirit of immortal man, attempts his first outbreak into the domain
of unlimited inquiry, unless he take heed of the needfully-cautious
prudentialities of mundane observance, there infallibly attends him
a fatal Mephistophelean influence, of which the malign tendency,
from every conclusion of eventuality, is to plunge him into
perilous vast cloud-waves of the dream-inhabited vague. Let, then,
the young student of infinity &mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<h4>FLIGHT THE FIFTH.</h4>
<p>Inarched within the boundless empyrean of thought, starry with
wonder, and constellate with investigation; at one time obfuscated
in the abysm-born vapours of doubt; at another, radiant with the
sun-fires of faith made perfect by fruition; it can amaze no
considerative fraction of humanity, that the explorer of the
indefinite, the searcher into the not-to-be-defined, should, at
dreary intervals, invent dim, plastic riddles of his own identity,
and hesitate at the awful shrine of that dread interrogatory
alternative&mdash;reality, or dream? This deeply pondering, let the
eager beginner in the at once linear and circumferent course of
philosophico-metaphysical contemplativeness, introductively assure
himself that &mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<h4>FINAL FLIGHT.</h4>
<p>As, &ldquo;in the silence and overshadowing of that night whose
fitful meteoric fires only herald the descent of a superficial fame
into lasting oblivion, the imbecile and unavailing resistance which
is made against the doom must often excite our pity for the
pampered child of market-gilded popularity;&rdquo; and as &ldquo;it
is not with such feelings that we behold the dark thraldom and
long-suffering of true intellectual strength,&rdquo; of which the
&ldquo;brief, though frequent, soundings beneath the earthly
pressure will be heard even amidst the din of flaunting crowds, or
the solemn conclaves of common-place minds,&rdquo; of which the
&ldquo;obscured head will often shed forth ascending beams that can
only be lost in eternity;&rdquo; and of which the &ldquo;mighty
struggles to upheave its own weight, and that of the superincumbent
mass of prejudice, envy, ignorance, folly, or uncongenial force,
must ever ensure the deepest sympathy of all those who can
appreciate the spirit of its qualities;&rdquo; let the initiative
skyward struggles towards the zenith-abysses of the inane
impalpable &mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>

<h2>DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE STATUE OF GEORGE CANNING AND SIR ROBERT
PEEL.</h2>
<p>The new Premier was taking a solitary stroll the other evening
through Palace-yard, meditating upon the late turn which had
brought the Tories to the top of the wheel and the Whigs to the
bottom, and pondering on the best ways and means of keeping his
footing in the slippery position that had cost him so much labour
to attain. While thus employed, with his eyes fixed on the ground,
and his hands buried in his breeches-pockets, he heard a voice at
no great distance, calling in familiar tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob! Bob!&mdash;I say, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alarmed Baronet stopped, and looked around him to discover
the speaker, when, casting his eyes upon the statue of George
Canning in the enclosure of Westminster Abbey, he was astonished to
perceive it nodding its head at him, like the statue in &ldquo;Don
Giovanni,&rdquo; in a &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; kind of way.
Sir Robert, who, since his introduction to the Palace, has grown
perilously polite, took off his hat, and made a low bow to the
figure.</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;Bah! no nonsense, Bob, with me! Put on your hat,
and come over here, close to the railings, while I have a little
private confab with you. So, you have been called in at last?</p>
<p>PEEL.&mdash;Yes. Her Majesty has done me the honour to command
my services; and actuated by a sincere love of my country, I obeyed
the wishes of my Royal Mistress, and accepted office; though, if I
had consulted my own inclinations, I should have preferred the
quiet path of private&mdash;</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;Humbug! You forget yourself, Bob; you are not now
at Tamworth, or in the house, but talking to an old hand that knows
every move on the political board,&mdash;you need have no disguise
with me. Come, be candid for once, and tell me, what are your
intentions?</p>
<p>PEEL.&mdash;Why, then, candidly, to keep my place as long as I
can&mdash;</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;Undoubtedly; that is the first duty of every
patriotic minister! But the means, Bob?</p>
<p>PEEL&mdash;Oh! Cant&mdash;cant&mdash;nothing but cant! I shall
talk of my feeling for the wants of the people, while I pick their
pockets; bestow my pity upon the manufacturers, while I tax the
bread that feeds their starving families; and proclaim my sympathy
with the farmers, while I help the arrogant landlords to grind them
into the dust.</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;Ah! I perceive yon understand the true principles
of legislation. Now, <em>I</em> once really felt what you only
feign. In my time, I attempted to carry out my ideas of
amelioration, and wanted to improve the moral and physical
condition of the people, but&mdash;</p>
<p>PEEL.&mdash;You failed. Few gave you credit for purely patriotic
motives&mdash;and still fewer believed you to be sincere in your
professions. Now, <em>my</em> plan is much easier, and safer. Give
the people fair promises&mdash;they don&rsquo;t cost much&mdash;but
nothing besides promises; the moment you attempt to realise the
hopes you have raised, that moment you raise a host of enemies
against yourself.</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;But if you make promises, the nation will demand a
fulfilment of them.</p>
<p>PEEL.&mdash;I have an answer ready for all
comers&mdash;&ldquo;Wait awhile!&rdquo; &rsquo;Tis a famous soother
for all impatient grumblers. It kept the Whigs in office for ten
years, and I see no reason why it should not serve our turn as
long. Depend upon it, &ldquo;Wait awhile&rdquo; is the great secret
of Government.</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;Ah! I believe you are right. I now see that I was
only a novice in the trade of politics. By the bye, Bob, I
don&rsquo;t at all like my situation here; &rsquo;tis really very
uncomfortable to be exposed to all weathers&mdash;scorched in
summer, and frost-nipped in winter. Though I am only a statue, I
feel that I ought to be protected.</p>
<p>PEEL.&mdash;Undoubtedly, my dear sir. What can I do for you?</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;Why, I want to get into the Abbey, St.
Paul&rsquo;s, or Drury Lane. Anywhere out of the open air.</p>
<p>PEEL.&mdash;Say no more&mdash;it shall be done. I am only too
happy to have it in my power to serve the statue of a man to whom
his country is so deeply indebted.</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;But <em>when</em> shall it be done, Bob?
To-morrow?</p>
<p>PEEL.&mdash;Not precisely to-morrow; but&mdash;</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;Next week, then?</p>
<p>PEEL.&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say; but don&rsquo;t be
impatient&mdash;rely on my promise, and <em>wait awhile, wait
awhile</em>, my dear friend. Good night.</p>
<p>STATUE.&mdash;Oh! confound your <em>wait awhile</em>. I see I
have nothing to expect.</p>

<h2>PUNCH AT THE ART-UNION EXHIBITION AGAIN</h2>
<p>Limited space in our last number prevented our noticing any
other than the Sleeping Beauty; and, as there are many other
humorous productions possessing equal claims to our attention in
the landscape and other departments of art, we shall herein
endeavour to point out their characteristics&mdash;more for the
advantage of future purchasers than for the better and further
edification of those whose meagre notions and tastes have already
been shown. And as the Royal Academicians, par courtesy, demand our
first notice, we shall, having wiped off D. M&rsquo;Clise, R.A.,
now proceed, baton in hand, to make a few pokes at W.F.
Witherington, R.A., upon his work entitled &ldquo;Winchester Tower,
Windsor Castle, from Romney Lock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a subject which has been handled many times within our
recollection, by artists of less name, less fame, and less
pretensions to notice, if we except the undeniable fact of their
displaying infinitely more ability in their representations of the
subject, than can by any possibility be discovered in the one by W.
F. Witherington, R.A. If our remarks were made with an affectionate
eye to the young ladies of the satin-album-loving school, we should
assuredly style this &ldquo;a duck of a picture&rdquo;&mdash;one
after their own hearts&mdash;treated in mild and undisturbed tones
of yellow, blue, and pink&mdash;and what yellows! what blues! and
what pinks! Some kind, superintending genius of landscape-painting
evidently prepared the scene for W.F. Witherington, R.A. It
displays nothing of the vulgar every-day look of nature, as seen at
Romney Lock, or any other spot; not a pebble out of its
place&mdash;not a leaf deranged&mdash;here are bright amber trees,
and blue metallic towers, prepared gravel-walks, and figures nicely
cleaned and bleached to suit; it is, in truth, the most genteel
landscape ever looked on. Nothing but absolute needlework can
create more wonderment. Fie! fie! get thee hence, W.F.
Witherington, R.A.</p>
<p>Just placed over the last-mentioned picture, and, doubtlessly so
arranged that the gentle R.A. should find that, although his bright
specimen of mild murder may be adjudged the worst in the
collection, still there are others worthy of being classed in the
same order of oddities. Behold No. 19, entitled,
&ldquo;Landscape&mdash;Evening&mdash;J.F. Gilbert,&rdquo; and
selected by Mr. John Bullock from the Royal Academy.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; In the charitable hope that
there is a chance of this purchaser being toned down in the course
of time, after the same manner that pictures are, and, by that
process, display more sobriety, we most humbly offer to Mr. B. our
modest judgment upon his selection (not upon his choice, but upon
the thing chosen). That it is a landscape we gloomily admit; but
that it represents &ldquo;Evening&rdquo; we steadily deny. The
exact period of the day, after much puzzling and deliberation, we
cannot arrive at; one thing yet we are assured of&mdash;that it has
been painted in company with a clock that was either too fast or
too slow. The composition, which has very much the appearance of
the by-gone century, is a prime selection from the finest parts of
those very serene views to be found adorning the lowest interiors
of wash-hand basins, with a dash from the works of Smith of
Chichester, whose mental elevation in his profession was only
surpassed by the high finish of his apple-trees, and the elaborate
nothingness of his general choice of subject. In the foreground of
the picture, the artist has, however, most aptly introduced the two
vagabonds invariably to be seen idling in the foregrounds of
landscapes of this class&mdash;two rascally scouts who have put in
appearance from time immemorial; they are here just as in the works
alluded to, the one sitting, the other of course standing, and
courteously bending to receive the remarks of his friend. By the
side of the stream, which flows through (or rather takes up) the
middle of the picture, and immediately opposite to the two
everlastings, is a little plain-looking agriculturist, who appears
to be watching them. He is in the careless and ever-admitted
picturesque position of leaning over a garden fence; but whether
the invariables are aware of the little gentleman, and are
consequently conversing in an undertone, we leave every beholder to
speculate and settle for himself. Behind the worthy small farmer,
and coming from the door of his residence, most cleverly
introduced, is his wife (we know it to represent the wife, from the
clear fact of the lady&rsquo;s appearance being typical of the
gentleman&rsquo;s), who is in the act of observing that the
children are waiting his presence at table, and adding, no doubt,
that he had better come in and assist her in the cabbage-and-bacon
duties of the repast, than lose his time and annoy the family.</p>
<p>We must now draw the spectator from the above-mentioned objects
to a little piscatorial sportsman, who, apart from them, and in the
retirement of his own thoughts upon worms, ground-bait, and catgut,
lends his aid, together with a lively little amateur waterman,
paddling about in a little boat, selfishly built to hold none other
than himself&mdash;a hill rising in the middle ground, and two or
three minor editions of the same towards the distance, carefully
dotted with trees, after the fashion of a ready-made portable park
from the toy <em>depot</em> in the Lowther Arcade&mdash;two
bee-hives, a water-mill, some majestic smoke, something that looks
like a skein of thread thrown over a mountain, and the memorable
chiaro-scuro, form the interesting episodes of this glorious essay
in the epic pastoral.</p>

<h2>SYNCRETIC LITERATURE</h2>
<p class="note"><em>Observations on the Epic Poem of Giles
Scroggins and Molly Brown&mdash;resumed.</em></p>
<p>The fatal operation of the unavoidable, ever-impending, ruthless
shears of the stern controller of human destiny, and curtailer of
human life&mdash;the action by which</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Fate&rsquo;s scissors cut Giles Scroggins&rsquo;
thread,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or rather the thread of Giles Scroggins&rsquo; life, at once and
most completely establishes the wholesome moral as to the fearful
uncertainty of all sublunary anticipations, and stands forth a
beautiful beacon to warn the over-weaning &ldquo;worldly
wisemen&rdquo; from their often too-fondly-cherished dreams of
realising, by their own means and appliances, the darling projects
of their ambitious hopes!</p>
<p>The immediate effect of the operation performed by Fate&rsquo;s
scissors, or rather by Fate herself&mdash;as she was the great and
absolute disposer&mdash;to whom the implement employed was but a
matter of fancy; for had Fate so chosen, a bucket, a bowie-knife, a
brick-bat, a black cap, or a box of patent pills, might, as well as
her destructive shears, have made a tenant for a yawning grave of
doomed Giles Scroggins. We say, the immediate effect arising from
this cutting cause was one in which both parties&mdash;the living
bride and defunct bridegroom&mdash;were equally concerned, their
lover&rsquo;s co-partnership rendering each liable for the acts or
accidents of the other; therefore as may be (and we think is)
clearly established, under these circumstances,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;They could <em>not</em> be <em>mar-ri</em>-ed!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is something deliciously affecting in the beautiful
drawing out of the last syllable!&mdash;it seems like the lingering
of the heart&rsquo;s best feelings upon the blighted prospects of
its purest joys!&mdash;the ceremony that would have completed the
union of the loving maiden and admiring swain, blending, as it
were, like the twin prongs of a brass-bound toasting-fork, their
interests in one common cause. The ceremony of love&rsquo;s
concentration can never be performed! but the heart-feeling poet
extends each tiny syllable even to its utmost stretch, that the
tear-dropping reader may, while gulping down his sympathies, make
at least a handsome mouthful of the word.</p>
<p>We now approach, with considerable awe, a portion of our task to
which we beg to call the undivided attention of our erudite
readers. Upon referring to the original black-letter quarto, we
find, after each particular sentence, the author introduces, with
consummate tact, a line, meant, as we presume, as a kind of
literary resting-place, upon which the delighted mind might, in the
sweet indulgence of repose, reflect with greater pleasure on the
thrilling parts, made doubly thrilling by the poet&rsquo;s fire.
The diversity of these, if we may so express them, &ldquo;camp
stools&rdquo; of imagination, is worthy of remark, both as to their
application and amplitude. For instance, after <em>one</em> line,
and that if perused with attention, comparatively less abstruse
than its fellows, the gifted poet satisfies himself with the
insertion of three sonorous, but really simple syllables, they are
invariably at follows&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Too-ral-loo!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But when <em>two</em> lines of the poem&mdash;burning with
thought, bursting with action&mdash;entrance by their sublimity the
enraptured reader, greater time is given, and more extended
accommodation for a mental sit-down is afforded in the elaborate
and elongated composition of</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Whack! fol-de-riddle lol-de-day!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These introductions are of a high classic origin. Many
professors of eminence have quarrelled as to whether they were not
the original of the &ldquo;Greek chorus;&rdquo; while others, of
equal erudition, have as stoutly maintained, though closely
approximating in character and purpose, they are not the
&ldquo;originals,&rdquo; but imitations, and decidedly admirable
ones, from those celebrated poets.</p>
<p>A Mr. William Waters, a gentleman of immense travel, one who had
left the burning zone of the far East to visit the more chilling
gales of a European climate, a philosopher of the sect known as the
&ldquo;Peripatetic,&rdquo; a devoted follower of the heathen Nine,
whose fostering care has ever been devoted to the tutelage of the
professors of sweet sounds; and therefore Waters was a high
authority, declared in the peculiar <em>patois</em> attendant upon
the pronunciation of a foreign mode of speech&mdash;that</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Too-ral-loo&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>was to catch him wind! And</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Whack! fol-de-riddle lol-de-day,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>to let &ldquo;um rosin up him fuddlestick!&rdquo; These
deductions are practical, if not poetical; but these are but the
emanations from the brain of one&mdash;hundreds of other
commentators differ from his view.</p>
<p>The most erudite linguists are excessively puzzled as to the
nation whose peculiar language has been resorted to for these
singular and unequalled introductions. The</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Too-ral-loo&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>has been given up in despair. The nearest solution was that of
an eminent arithmetician, who conjectured from the word too
(Anglice, <em>two</em>)&mdash;and the use of the four
cyphers&mdash;those immediately following the T and L&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>[pg
113]</span> they were intended to convey some notion of the
personal property of Giles Scroggins or Molly Brown (he never made
up his mind which of the two); and merely wanted the following
marks to render them plain:&mdash;</p>
<p>T&mdash;oo (<em>two</em>)&mdash;either shillings or
pence&mdash;and L&mdash;oo: no pounds!</p>
<p>This may or may not be right, but the research and ingenuity
deserve the immortality we now confer upon it. The other line,
the</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Whack! fol-de-riddle lol-de-day!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>has, perhaps, given rise to far more controversy, with certainly
less tangible and satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The scene of the poem not being expressly stated in the original
or early black-letter translation, many persons&mdash;whose love of
country prompted their wishes&mdash;have endeavoured to attach a
nationality to these gordian knots of erudition. An Hibernian
gentleman of immense research&mdash;the celebrated &ldquo;Darby
Kelly&rdquo;&mdash;has openly asserted the whole affair to be
decidedly of Milesian origin: and, amid a vast number of
corroborative circumstances, strenuously insists upon the solidity
of his premises and deductions by triumphantly exclaiming,
&ldquo;What, or who but an <em>Irish</em> poet and an Irish hero,
would commence a matter of so much consequence with the
soul-stirring &ldquo;whack!&rdquo; adopted by the great author, and
put into the mouth of his chosen hero?&rdquo; Others again have
supposed&mdash;which is also far more improbable&mdash;that much of
the obscurity of the above passage has its origin from simple
mis-spelling on the part of the poet&rsquo;s amanuensis&mdash;he
taking the literal dictation, forgetting the sublime author was
suffering from a cold in the head, which rendered the words in
sound&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Riddle <em>lol</em> the lay;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>whereas they would otherwise have been pronounced&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Riddle&mdash;<em>all the day</em>&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>that being an absolute and positive allusion to the agricultural
pursuits of Giles Scroggins, he being generally employed by his
more wealthy master&mdash;a great agrarian of those times&mdash;in
the manly though somewhat fatiguing occupation of &ldquo;riddling
all the day:&rdquo; an occupation which&mdash;like this
article&mdash;was to be frequently resumed.</p>

<h2>A NEW THEORY OF POCKETS.</h2>
<p class="note">DEFINITION <em>Pocket</em>, s. the small bag
inserted into clothes.&mdash;WALKER (<em>a new edition, by
Hookey</em>).</p>
<p>We are great on the subject of pockets&mdash;we acknowledge
it&mdash;we avow it. From our youth upwards, and we are venerable
now, we have made them the object of untiring research, analysis,
and speculation; and if our exertions have occasionally involved us
in contingent predicaments, or our zeal laid us open to
conventional misconstructions, we console ourselves with Galileo
and Tycho Brahe, who having, like us, discovered and arranged
systems too large for the scope of the popular intellect, like us,
became the martyrs of those great principles of science which they
have immortalized themselves by teaching.</p>
<p>The result of a course of active and careful (s)peculations on
the philosophy and economy of pockets, has led us to the conviction
that their intention and use are but very imperfectly understood,
even by the intelligent and reflective section of the community. It
is, we fear, a very common error to regard them as conventional
recesses, adapted for the reception and deposit of such luxurious
additaments to the attire as are detached, yet accessory and
indispensable ministers to our comfort. Now this delusive
supposition is diametrically opposed to the truth. Pockets (we must
be plain)&mdash;pockets are not made <em>to put into</em>, but to
<em>take out of</em>; and, although it is of course necessary that,
in order to produce the result of withdrawal, they be previously
furnished with the wherewithal to withdraw, yet the process of
insertion and supply is only carried on for the purpose of
assisting the operation of the system.</p>
<p>And having, we trust, logically established this point, we shall
hazard no incautious position in asserting that the man who empties
a pocket, fulfils the object for which it was founded and
established. And although, unhappily, a prejudice still exists in
the minds of the uneducated, in favour of emptying their own
pockets themselves, it must be evident that none but a narrow mind
can take umbrage at the trifling acceleration of an event which
must inevitably occur; or would desire to appropriate the credit of
the distribution, as well as to deserve the merit of the
supply.</p>
<p>We perceive with concern and apprehension, that pockets are
gradually falling into disuse. To use the flippant idiom of the
day, they are going out! This is an alarming, as well as a
lamentable fact; and one, too, strikingly illustrative of the
degeneracy of modern fashions. Whether we ascribe the change to a
contemptuous neglect of ancestral institutions, or to an increasing
difficulty in furnishing the indispensable attributes of the
pocket, it is alike indicative of a crisis; and we confess that it
is matter of astonishment to us, that in these days of theory and
hypothesis, no man has ventured to trace the distress and the ruin
now impending over the country, to the increasing disrespect and
disuse of&mdash;pockets.</p>
<p>By way of approving our conjecture, let us contrast the garments
of the hour with those of England in the olden time&mdash;long ago,
when boards smoked and groaned under a load of good things in every
man&rsquo;s house; when the rich took care of the poor, and the
poor took care of themselves; when husband and wife married for
love, and lived happily (though that must have been very long ago
indeed); the athletic yeoman proceeded to his daily toil, enveloped
in garments instinct with pockets. The ponderous watch&mdash;the
plethoric purse&mdash;the massive snuff-box&mdash;the dainty
tooth-pick&mdash;the grotesque handkerchief; all were accommodated
and cherished in the more ample recesses of his coat; while
supplementary fobs were endeared to him by their more seductive
contents: <em>as</em> ginger lozenges, love-letters, and
turnpike-tickets. Such were the days on which we should reflect
with regret; such were the men whom we should imitate and revere.
Had such a character as we have endeavoured feebly to sketch, met
an individual enveloped in a shapeless cylindrical tube of pale
Macintosh&mdash;impossible for taste&mdash;incapable of
pockets&mdash;indefinite and indefinable&mdash;we question whether
he would have regarded him in the light of a maniac, an incendiary,
or a foreign spy&mdash;whether he would not have handed him
immediately over to the exterminators of the law, as a being too
depraved, too degraded for human sympathy. And yet&mdash;for our
prolixity warns us to conclude&mdash;and yet the festering
contagion of this baneful example is now-a-days hidden under the
mask of fashion. FASHION! and has it indeed come to this? Is
fashion to trample on the best and finest feelings of our nature?
Is fashion to be permitted to invade us in our green lanes, and our
high roads, under our vines and our fig-trees, without hindrance,
and without pockets? For the sake of human nature, we hope
not&mdash;for the sake of our bleeding country, we hope not. No!
&ldquo;Take care of your pockets!&rdquo; is one of the earliest
maxims instilled into the youthful mind; and emphatically do we
repeat to our fellow-countrymen&mdash;Englishmen, take care of your
pockets!</p>

<p><span class="hide">C</span>ritics, as well as placemen, are
occasionally sinecurists, and, like the gentlemen of England
immortalised by Dibdin, are able, now and then, to &ldquo;live at
home at ease&rdquo;&mdash;to dine (on dining days) in comfort, not
having to rise from table to give authors or actors their dessert.
This kind of novelty in our lives takes place when managers produce
no novelties in their theatres; when authors are lazy, and actors
do not come out in new parts but are contented with wearing out old
ones&mdash;when, in short, such an eventless theatrical week as the
past one leaves us to the enjoyment of our own hookahs, and the
port of our cellar-keeping friends. The play-bills seem to have
been printed from stereotype, for, like the laws of the Medes and
Persians, they have never altered&mdash;since our last report.</p>
<p>This unexpected hot weather has visited the public with many a
&ldquo;Midsummer night&rsquo;s dream,&rdquo; <em>although</em> it
is&mdash;and Covent Garden has opened <em>because</em> it is
September; Sheridan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Critic&rdquo; has been very busy
there, though PUNCH&rsquo;S has had nothing to do. &ldquo;London
Assurance&rdquo; is still seen to much advantage, and so is Madame
Vestris.</p>
<p>The Haymarket manager continues to wade knee-deep in tragedy, in
spite of the state of the weather. The fare is, however, too good
for any change in the <em>carte</em>. &ldquo;Werner&rdquo; forms a
substantial standing dish. The &ldquo;Boarding School&rdquo; makes
a most palpable <em>entr&eacute;e</em>; while &ldquo;Bob
Short,&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Friend the Captain,&rdquo; serve as
excellent after-courses. The promises recorded in the Haymarket
bills are, a new tragedy by a new author, and an old comedy called
&ldquo;Riches;&rdquo; a certain hit, if the continued success of
&ldquo;Money&rdquo; be any criterion.</p>
<p>It is with feelings of the most rabid indignation that we
approach the <em>Strand Theatre</em>, and the ruthless threat its
announcements put forth of the future destruction of the only
legitimate drama that is now left amongst us; that is to say,
&ldquo;PUNCH.&rdquo; When Thespis and his pupil Phynicus
&ldquo;came out&rdquo; at the feasts of Bacchus; when
&ldquo;Roscius was an actor in Rome;&rdquo; when Scaramouch turned
the Materia Medica into a farce, and became a quack doctor in
Italy; when Richardson set up his show in England&mdash;all these
geniuses were peregrinate, peripatetic&mdash;their scenes were
really moving ones, their tragic woes went upon wheels, their
comedies were run through at the rate of so many miles per hour;
the entire drama was, in fact, a travelling concern. Punch, the
concentrated essence of all these, has, up to this date, preserved
the pristine purity of his peripatetic fame; he still remains on
circuit, he still retains his legitimacy. But, alas! ere this sheet
has passed through the press, while its ink is yet as wet as our
dear Judy&rsquo;s eyes, he will have fallen from his high estate:
Hall will have housed him! Punch will have taken a stationary stand
at the Strand Theatre!! The last stroke will have been given to the
only ancient drama remaining, except the tragedies of Sophocles,
and &ldquo;Gammer Gurton&rsquo;s Needle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With feelings of both sorrow and anger, we turn from the
pedestrian to the equestrian drama. The Surrey has again, as of
yore, become the Circus; she has been joined to Ducrow and his stud
by the usual symbol of union&mdash;a <em>ring</em>.
&ldquo;Mazeppa&rdquo; is <em>ridden</em> by Mr. Cartlitch, with
great success, and the wild horse performed by an animal so highly
trained, that it is as tame as a lap-dog&mdash;has galloped through
a score or so of nights, to the delight of some thousands of
spectators. The scenes in the circle exhibit the usual
<em>round</em> of entertainment, and the <em>Merryman</em> delivers
those reliques of antique faceti&aelig; which have descended to the
clowns of the ring from generation to generation, without the
smallest innovation. Thus the Surrey shows symptoms of high
prosperity, and properly declines to fly in Fortune&rsquo;s face by
attempting novelty.</p>
<p>The Victoria continues to kill &ldquo;James Dawson,&rdquo; in
spite of our prediction. The bills, however, promise that he shall
die outright on Monday next, and a happy release it will be. The
proprietor of &ldquo;Sadler&rsquo;s Wells&rdquo; is making most
spirited efforts to attract play-goers to the Islington side of the
New River, by a return to the legitimate drama of <em>his</em>
theatre, viz.&mdash;real water; while his box check-taker has kept
one important integer of the public away; namely, that singular
plural <em>we</em>&mdash;by impertinence for which we have
exhausted all patience without obtaining redress.</p>
<p>There are, we hear, other theatres open in London, one called
the &ldquo;City of London,&rdquo; somewhere near Shoreditch;
another in Whitechapel, both <em>terr&aelig; incognit&aelig;</em>
to us. The proprietors of these have handsomely presented us with
free admissions. We beg them to accept our thanks for their
courtesy; but are sorry we cannot avail ourselves of it till they
add the obligation of providing us with <em>guides</em>.</p>

<h2>THE CORN LAWS AND CHRISTIANITY.</h2>
<p>Doctor Chalmers refused to attend the synod of Clergymen
gathered together to consider the relative value of the Big and
Little Loaf, on the ground that the reverend gentlemen were
beginning their work at the wrong end. Wages will go up with
Christianity, says the Doctor; cheap corn will follow the
dissemination of cheap Bibles. &ldquo;I know of no other road for
the indefinite advancement of the working classes to a far better
remuneration, and, of course, a far more liberal maintenance, in
return for their toils, than they have ever yet enjoyed&mdash;it is
a <em>universal Christian education</em>.&rdquo; Such are the words
of Doctor CHALMERS.</p>
<p>We perfectly agree with the reverend doctor. Instead of shipping
Missionaries to Africa, let us keep those Christian sages at home
for the instruction of the English Aristocracy. When we consider
the benighted condition of the elegant savages of the western
squares,&mdash;when we reflect upon the dreadful scepticism
abounding in Park-lane, May-fair, Portland-place and its
vicinity,&mdash;when we contemplate the abominable idols which
these unhappy natives worship in their ignorance,&mdash;when we
know that every thought, every act of their misspent life is
dedicated to a false religion, when they make hourly and daily
sacrifice to that brazen serpent,</p>
<p class="cen">SELF!&mdash;</p>
<p>when they offer up the poor man&rsquo;s sweat to the
abomination,&mdash;when they lay before it the crippled child of
the factory,&mdash;when they take from life its bloom and dignity,
and degrading human nature to mere brute breathing, make offering
of its wretchedness as the most savoury morsel to the perpetual
craving of their insatiate god,&mdash;when we consider all the
&ldquo;manifold sins and wickednesses&rdquo; of the barbarians in
purple and fine linen, of those pampered savages &ldquo;whose eyes
are red with wine and whose teeth white with milk,&rdquo;&mdash;we
do earnestly hope that the suggestion of Doctor Chalmers will be
carried into immediate practical effect, and that Missionaries,
preaching true Christianity, will be sent among the rich and
benighted people of this country,&mdash;so that the poor may
believe that the Scriptures are something more than mere printed
paper, seeing their glorious effects in the awakened hearts of
those who, in the arrogance of their old idolatry, called
themselves their betters!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A universal Christian education!&rdquo; To this end, the
Bench of Bishops meet at Lambeth; and discovering that locusts and
wild honey&mdash;the Baptist&rsquo;s diet&mdash;may be purchased
for something less than ten thousand a year,&mdash;and, after a
minute investigation of the Testament, failing to discover the name
of St. Peter&rsquo;s coachmaker, or of St. Paul&rsquo;s footman,
his valet, or his cook,&mdash;take counsel one with another, and
resolve to forego at least nine-tenths of their yearly in-comings.
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; they exclaim&mdash;and what apostolic brightness
beams in the countenance of CANTERBURY&mdash;what celestial light
plays about the fleshy head of LONDON&mdash;what more than
saint-like beauty surprises the cowslip-coloured face of
EXETER&mdash;what lambent fire, what looks of Christian love play
about and beam from the whole episcopal
Bench!&mdash;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; they cry&mdash;&ldquo;we will no
longer have the spirit oppressed by these cumbrous trappings of
fleshy pride! We will promote an universal Christian
education&mdash;we will teach charity by examples, and live unto
all men by a personal abstinence from the bickerings and malice of
civil life. We will not defile the sacred lawn with the mud of
turnpike acts&mdash;we will no longer sweat in the House of Lords,
but labour only in the House of the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their Christian hearts sweetly suffused with sudden meekness,
the Bishops proceed&mdash;staff in hand, and Bible under
arm&mdash;from Lambeth Palace. How the people make way for the holy
procession! Hackney-coachmen on their stands uncover themselves,
and the drayman, surprised in his whistle, doffs his beaver to the
reverend pilgrims. With measured step and slow, they proceed to
Downing-street; the self-deputed Missionaries, resolved to give her
Majesty&rsquo;s ministers &ldquo;a Christian education.&rdquo; Sir
ROBERT PEEL is immediately taken in hand by the Bishop of EXETER;
who sets the Baronet to learn and exemplify the practical beauties
of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer. When Sir ROBERT comes to &ldquo;give us
this day our daily bread,&rdquo; he insists upon adding the words
&ldquo;<em>with a sliding scale</em>.&rdquo; However, EXETER,
animated by a sudden flux of Christianity, keeps the baronet to his
lesson, and the Premier is regenerated; yea, is &ldquo;a brand
snatched from the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord LYNDHURST makes a great many wry mouths at some parts of
the Decalogue&mdash;we will not particularise them&mdash;but the
Bishop of London is resolute, and the new Lord Chancellor is, in
all respects a bran-new Christian.</p>
<p>Lord STANLEY begs that when he prays for power to forgive all
his enemies, he may be permitted to except from that
prayer&mdash;DANIEL O&rsquo;CONNELL. The Bishop is, however,
inexorable; and O&rsquo;Connell is to be prayed for, in all
churches visited by Lord STANLEY.</p>
<p>Several of the bishops, smitten by the heathen darkness of the
great majority of the Cabinet&mdash;affected by their utter
ignorance of the practical working of Christianity&mdash;burst into
tears. It will not be credited by those disposed to think
charitably of their fellow-creatures, that&mdash;we state the
melancholy fact upon the golden word of the Bishop of
EXETER&mdash;several Cabinet ministers had never heard of the
divine sentence which enjoins upon us to do to others as we would
they should do unto us. Sir JAMES GRAHAM, for instance, declared
that he had always understood the passage to simply
run&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Do</em> others;&rdquo; and had, therefore, in
very many acts of his political life, squared his doings according
to the mutilated sentence. All the Cabinet had, more or less, some
idea of the miracle of the Loaves and the Fishes. Indeed, many of
them confessed that with them, the Loaves and the Fishes had,
during their whole political career, contained the essence of
Christianity. Sir EDWARD KNATCHBULL, Lord ELLENBOROUGH, and
GOULBURN declared that for the last ten years they had hungered for
nothing else.</p>
<p>We cannot dwell upon every individual case of ignorance
displayed in the Cabinet. We confine ourselves to the glad
statement, that every minister from the first lord of the treasury
to the grooms in waiting, vivified by the sacred heat of their
schoolmaster Bishops, illustrate the great truth of Doctor
CHALMERS, that the poor man can only obtain justice &ldquo;by a
<em>universal</em> Christian education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bench of Bishops do not confine their labours to the
instruction of the Cabinet. By no means. They have appointed
prebends, deans, canons, vicars, &amp;c., to teach the members of
both houses of Parliament practical Christianity towards their
fellow-men. Lord LONDONDERRY has sold his fowling-piece for the
benefit of the poor&mdash;has given his shooting-jacket to the
ragged beggar that sweeps the crossing opposite the Carlton
Club&mdash;and resolving to forego the vanities of grouse, is now
hard at work on &ldquo;The Acts of the Apostles.&rdquo; Colonel
SIBTHORP&mdash;after unceasing labour on the part of Doctor
CROLY&mdash;has managed to spell at least six of the hard names in
the first chapter of St. Matthew, and can now, with very slight
hesitation, declare who was the father of ZEBEDEE&rsquo;S
children!</p>
<p>&ldquo;An universal Christian education!&rdquo; Oh, reader!
picture to yourself London&mdash;for one day only&mdash;operated
upon by the purest Christianity. Consider the mundane interests of
this tremendous metropolis directed by Apostolic principles!
Imagine the hypocrisy of respectability&mdash;the conventional
lie&mdash;the allowed ceremonial deceit&mdash;the tricks of
trade&mdash;the ten thousand scoundrel subterfuges by which the
lowest dealers of this world purchase Bank-stock and rear their own
pine-apples&mdash;the common, innocent iniquities (innocent from
their very antiquity, having been bequeathed from sire to son)
which men perpetrate six working-days in the week, and after,
lacker up their faces with a look of sleek humility for the Sunday
pew&mdash;consider all this locust swarm of knaveries annihilated
by the purifying spirit of Christianity, and then look upon London
breathing and living, for one day only, by the sweet, sustaining
truth of the Gospel!</p>
<p>Had our page ten thousand times its amplitude, it would not
contain the briefest register of the changes of that day!</p>
<p>There is a scoundrel attorney, who for thirty years has become
plethoric on broken hearts. The scales of leprous villany have
fallen from him; and now, an incarnation of justice, he sits with
open doors, to pour oil into the wounds of the smitten&mdash;to
make man embrace man as his brother&mdash;to preach lovingkindness
to all the world, and&mdash;without a fee&mdash;to chant the
praises of peace and amity.</p>
<p><em>Crib</em> the stockbroker meets <em>Horns</em> a
fellow-labourer in the same hempen walk of life. <em>Crib</em>
offers to buy a little Spanish of <em>Horns</em>. &ldquo;My dear
<em>Crib</em>,&rdquo; says <em>Horns</em>, &ldquo;it is impossible;
I can&rsquo;t sell; for I have just received by a private hand from
Cadiz, news that must send the stock down to nothing. I am a
Christian, my dear <em>Crib</em>,&rdquo; says <em>Horns</em>,
&ldquo;and as a Christian, how could I sell you a certain
loss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mistaken, but well-meaning man, although a tailor, meets his
debtor in Bow-street. A slight quarrel ensues; whereupon, the
debtor (to show that the days of chivalry are <em>not</em> gone)
kicks his tailor into the gutter. Does the tailor take the offender
before Mr. JARDINE? By no means. The tailor is a Christian; and
learning the exact measure of his enemy, and returning good for
evil, he, in three days&rsquo; time, sends to his assailant a new
suit of the very best super Saxony.</p>
<p>How many quacks we see rushing to the various newspaper offices
to countermand their advertisements! What gaps in the columns of
the newspapers themselves! Where is the sugary lie&mdash;the adroit
slander&mdash;the scoundrel meanness, masking itself with the usage
of patriotism? All, all are vanished, for&mdash;the <em>Morning
Herald</em> is published upon Christian principles!</p>
<p>Let us descend to the smallest matters of social life.
&ldquo;Will this gingham wash?&rdquo; asks <em>Betty</em> the
housemaid of <em>Twill</em> the linen-draper. <em>Twill</em> is a
Christian; and therefore replies, &ldquo;it is a very poor article,
and it will <em>not</em> wash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are with Doctor Chalmers for Christianity&mdash;but not
Christianity of <em>one side</em>. &ldquo;Pray for those who
despitefully use you,&rdquo; say the Corn Law Apostles to the
famishing; and then, cocking their eye at one another, and
twitching their tongues in their mouths they add&mdash;&ldquo;for
this is Christianity!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE OMEN OUTWITTED:</h2>
<h3>OR, HOW HIS REVERENCE&rsquo;S HEELS TOOK STEPS TO SAVE HIS
HEAD.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;So, Dick, I mean your &lsquo;reverence,&rsquo; you like
the blessed old country as well as ever, eh, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well, ay, almost better. My return to it is like the
meeting of long-parted friends&mdash;the joy of the moment is pure
and unalloyed&mdash;all minor faults are forgotten&mdash;all former
goodness rushes with double force from the recollection to the
heart, and the renewal of old fellowship grafts new virtues (the
sweet fruits of regretted absence) upon him who has been the chosen
tenant of our &lsquo;heart of hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His reverence&rsquo;s health&mdash;three times three
(empty them heeltaps, Jack, and fill out of the fresh
jug)&mdash;now, boys, give tongue. That&rsquo;s the raal thing;
them cheers would wake the seven sleepers after a dose of laudanum.
Bless you, and long life to you! That&rsquo;s the worst wish
you&rsquo;ll find here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that right well, uncle. I know it, feel it, and
most heartily thank you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough said, parson. By dad, Dick, its mighty droll to be
calling you, that was but yesterday a small curly-pated gossoon, by
that clerical mouthful of a handle to your name. But do you find us
altered much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no change but Time&rsquo;s&mdash;that has fallen
lightly. To be sure, yesterday I was looking for the heads of my
strapping cousins at the bottom button of their well-filled
waistcoats, and, before Jack&rsquo;s arrival, meant to do a
paternal and patriarchal &lsquo;pat&rsquo; on his, at somewhere
about that altitude; a ceremony he must excuse, as the little lad
of my mind has thought proper to expand into a young Enniskillen of
six feet three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a mighty fine boy&mdash;the lady-killing
vagabone!&rdquo; said the father, with a kind look of gratified
pride; and then added, as if to stop the infection of the vanity,
&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no denying he&rsquo;s big enough to be
better.&rdquo; Here a slight scrimmage at the door of the
dining-room attracted the attention of the
&ldquo;masther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of that noise, ye
vagabones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spake up, Mickey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it me?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not at all,
by no means. Let Paddy do it, or Tim Carroll; they&rsquo;re used to
going out wid the car, and don&rsquo;t mind spaking to the
quality.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take yourselves out o&rsquo;that, or let me
know what you want, and be pretty quick about it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result of this order was the appearance of Tim Carroll in
the centre of the room&mdash;a dig between the shoulders, and
vigorously-applied kick behind, hastening him into that somewhat
uneasy situation, with a degree of expedition perfectly
marvellous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spake out, what is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo;
commenced Tim; &ldquo;you see, sir (<em>aside</em>), I&rsquo;ll be
even wid you for that kick, you thief of the world&mdash;you see,
Paddy (bad manners to him) and the rest o&rsquo; the boys, was
thinking that, owing to the change o&rsquo; climate, Master
Richard&mdash;that is, his new riverence&mdash;has gone through by
rason of laving England and comin&rsquo; here&mdash;and mighty
could, no doubt, he was on the journey&mdash;be praised he&rsquo;s
safe&mdash;the boy, sir, was thinkin&rsquo;, masther dear, it was
nothing but their duty, and what was due to the family, to ax your
honour&rsquo;s opinion about their takin&rsquo; the smallest taste
of whiskey in life, jist to be drinking his riverence&rsquo;s
Masther Richard&rsquo;s health, and&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Success to
him!&rdquo; shouted the chorus at the door. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
it!&rdquo; said the masther. &ldquo;And nothing but it!&rdquo;
responded the chorus. &ldquo;Nelly, my jewel! take the kays and
give them anything in dacency!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hurrah! smiling good
luck to you, for ever and afther!&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,
boys! but stay: it&rsquo;s Terence Conway&rsquo;s wedding
night&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good tenant he&rsquo;s been to
me&mdash;take the sup down there, and you&rsquo;ll get a dance; now
be off, you devils!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks to your honour!&rdquo; chorused the delighted
group; and &ldquo;I done that iligant, anyhow,&rdquo; muttered the
gratified, successful, and, therefore, forgiving orator.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try again. Ahem! wouldn&rsquo;t the young
gentlemen just step down for a taste?&rdquo; &ldquo;By all
manes!&rdquo; was chimed at once; their hats were mounted in a
moment, and off they set.</p>
<p>Terence Conway&rsquo;s farm was soon reached; the barn affording
the most accommodation for the numerous visitors, was fitted up for
the occasion. It was nearly full, as Terence was a popular
man&mdash;one that didn&rsquo;t grudge the &ldquo;bit and
sup,&rdquo; and never turned his back upon friend or foe. Loud and
hearty were the cheers of the delighted tenantry, as the three sons
of their beloved landlord passed the threshold. The appearance of
the &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; was received with no such demonstrations
of welcome; on the contrary, there was a sullen silence, soon after
broken by suppressed and angry murmurs. These were somewhat
appeased by one of the sons introducing his &ldquo;cousin,&rdquo;
and endeavouring to joke the peasants into good-humour, by
laughingly assuring them his &ldquo;reverence&rdquo; was but a bad
drinker, and would not deprive them of much of the poteen; then
passing his arm through the parson&rsquo;s, he led the way, as it
afterwards turned out, rather unfortunately, to the top of the
barn, and there, followed by his brothers, they took their
seats.</p>
<p>The entrance of the Catholic priest (a most amiable man) at this
moment attracted the entire attention of the party, during which
time Tim Carroll elbowed his way to the place where his master was
seated, and calling him partially aside, whispered, &ldquo;Master
John, dear, tell his riverence, Master Richard, to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, is not he entirely in black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it? Houly Paul! the likes o&rsquo; that! If my
skin was as hard as a miser&rsquo;s heart, I wouldn&rsquo;t put it
into a black coat, and come to a wedding in it; it&rsquo;s the
devil&rsquo;s own bad omen, and nothing else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right! What a fool I was not to tell Dick!
Cousin, a word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the clamour became somewhat louder, the priest taking an
active part, and speaking rapidly and earnestly in their native
tongue to the evidently excited peasantry. He suddenly broke from
them, and hastening to the Protestant clergyman, grasped his hand,
and, shaking it heartily, wished him &ldquo;health, long life, and
happiness:&rdquo; and lifting a tumbler of punch to his lips, drank
off nearly half its contents, exclaiming the customary, &ldquo;God
save all here!&rdquo; He then presented the liquor to the stranger,
saying in a low earnest voice, &ldquo;Drink that toast,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This order was instantly complied with. The clear tones of the
young man&rsquo;s unfaltering voice and the hearty cordiality of
his utterance had a singular effect upon the more turbulent; the
priest passed rapidly from the one to the other, and endeavoured to
say something pleasant to all, but, despite his attempts at
calmness, he was evidently ill at ease.</p>
<p>Tim Carroll again sidled up to his young master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys mane harrum, sir,&rdquo; said Tim; &ldquo;but
never mind, there&rsquo;s five of us here. We&rsquo;ve not been
idle, we&rsquo;ve all been taking pick o&rsquo; the sticks, and
divil a stroke falls upon one of the ould ancient family widout
showing a bruck head or a flat back for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to understand by this?&rdquo; inquired the
young stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re like Tom Fergusson when he rode the
losing horse&mdash;you&rsquo;ve mounted the wrong colour; and, be
dad, you are pretty well marked down for it, sir; but never mind,
there&rsquo;s Tim Carroll looking as black as the inside of a
sut-bag. Let him come on! he peeled the skin off them shins
o&rsquo; mine at futball; maybe, I won&rsquo;t trim his head with
black thorn for that same, if he&rsquo;s any ways obstropolis this
blessed night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, sir! neither my inclination nor sacred calling
will allow me to countenance a broil! I have been the first
offender&mdash;to attempt to leave the room now would but provoke
an attack; leave this affair to me, and don&rsquo;t
interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the powers! if man or mortal lifts his hand to injure
you, I&rsquo;ll smash the soul out of him! Do you think, omen or no
omen, I&rsquo;ll stand by and see you harmed?&mdash;not a bit of
it! If you are a parson and a child of peace, I have the honour to
be a soldier, and claim my right to battle in your
cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maugre the pacific tone of the unfortunately-accoutered
ecclesiastic, there was something of defiance in his flashing eye
and crimson cheek, as he turned his brightening glance upon what
might almost be called the host of his foes; and the nervous
pressure which returned the grasp of his cousin&rsquo;s sinewy
hand, spoke something more of readiness for battle than could have
been gathered from his expressed wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, Jack, it comes to that, why, as human nature is
weak&mdash;excuse what I may feel compelled to do; but for the
present pray oblige me by keeping your seat and the peace; or, if
you must move and fidget about, go and make that pugnacious Tim
Carroll as decent as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be advised by you, Dick; but look out!&rdquo;
So saying, the stalwart young officer bustled his way to the
uproarious Tim.</p>
<p>It was well he did so, or bloodshed must have ensued, as at that
moment a tall and powerful man, brother-in-law to the bride, lifted
his stick, and after giving it the customary twirl aimed a
point-blank blow at the head of the ill-omened parson. The bound of
an antelope brought the girl to the spot; her small hand averted
the direction of the deadly weapon, and before the action had been
perceived by any present, or the attempt could be resumed, she
dropped a curtesy to the assailant, and in a loud voice, with an
affected laugh, exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, if you plaise, sir;&rdquo; and, turning quickly to
the fiddler, continued: &ldquo;Any tune you like, Mr. Murphy, sir;
but, good luck to you, be quick, or we won&rsquo;t have a dance
to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear the floor!&mdash;a dance! a dance!&rdquo; shouted
every one.</p>
<p>In a few seconds the angry scowl had passed from the flushed
cheeks of Dan Sheeny, and there he was, toe and heeling, double
shuffling, and cutting it over the buckle, to the admiration of all
beholders. The bride was seated near the stranger&mdash;he
perceived this, and suddenly quitting his place, danced up to her,
and nodding, as he stopped for a moment, invited her to join him.
She was ever light of foot, and, as she said afterwards,
&ldquo;would have danced her life out but she&rsquo;d give the poor
young gentleman a chance.&rdquo; Long and vigorously did Dan Sheeny
advance, retire, curvette, and caper. The whiskey and exertion at
length overcame him, and he left the lady sole mistress of the
floor. By this time murmurs had again arisen, and all eyes were
turned upon the intruder, who had been intently engaged observing
the dancers. It was an accomplishment for which he had been
celebrated previous to his taking orders, and the old feeling so
strongly interested him, that he was absorbed in the pleasure of
witnessing the activity and joyousness of the performers. He turned
his head for an instant&mdash;a heavy hand was laid upon his
shoulder. On his starting up, he saw nothing but the smiling Norah
pressing the arm of a tall peasant, and curtseying him a challenge
to join her &ldquo;on the floor.&rdquo; He paused for a moment,
then gaily taking her hand, advanced with her to the centre. All
eyes were bent upon them, but there was no restraint in the young
parson&rsquo;s manner. The most popular jig-tune was called
for&mdash;to it they went; his early-taught and well-practised feet
beat living echoes to the most rapid bars. A foot of ground seemed
ample space for all the intricate compilation of the <em>raal</em>
Conamera &ldquo;capers.&rdquo; The tune was changed again and
again; again and again was his infinity of steps adapted to its
varying sounds: to use a popular phrase, you might have heard a pin
drop. Every mouth was closed, every eye fixed upon his rapid feet;
and, when at length wearied with exertion, the almost fainting girl
was falling to the earth, her gallant partner caught her in his
arms, and, like an infant, bore her to the open air, one loud and
general cheer burst from their unclosed lips; a few moments
restored the pretty lass to perfect health. Her first words were,
&ldquo;Leave me, sir, and save yourself.&rdquo; It was too late;
borne on the shoulders of the admiring mob, who, despite his suit
of sables (now rendered innoxious by the varying colour of the
crimson kerchief the young bride bound round his neck), he was soon
seated in the chair of honour, and there, surrounded by his
friends, finished the night the &ldquo;lion of the dance.&rdquo;
And thus it was that his &ldquo;Reverence&rsquo;s heels took steps
to preserve his head.&rdquo;&mdash;FUSBOS</p>

<h2>TRANSACTIONS AND YEARLY REPORT. OF THE HOOKHAM-CUM-SNIVEY
LITERARY, SCIENTIFIC, AND MECHANICS&rsquo; INSTITUTION.</h2>
<p class="cen">(<em>Continued from our last.</em>)</p>
<p>An important and advantageous arrangement in the transactions of
the society, since its foundation, has been the institution of the
classes &ldquo;for the acquisition of a general smattering of
everything,&rdquo; more especially as concerning the younger
branches of society. It is, however, much to be regretted, that the
public examination of the juvenile members, upon the subjects they
had listened to during the past course, did not turn out so well as
the committee could have wished. The various professors had taken
incredible pains to teach the infant philosophers correct answers
to the separate questions that would be asked them, in order that
they might reply with becoming readiness. Unfortunately the
examiner began at the wrong end of the class, and threw them all
out, except the middle one. We sub-join a few of the
questions:&mdash;</p>
<p>State the distance, in miles, from the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum to
the Tuesday in Easter week, and show how long a man would be going
from one to the other, if he travelled at the rate of four gallons
a minute.</p>
<p>Required to know the advantages of giving tracts to poor people
who cannot read, and how many are equivalent to a sliding-scale
penny buster, in the way of nourishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Lord John Russell in his Windsor uniform, ever
mistaken for a two-penny postman; if so, what great man imagined
the affinity?</p>

<p>The School of Design and Drawing has made very creditable
progress, and the subscribers will be gratified in learning, that
one of the pupils sent in a design for the Nelson Testamonial,
which would in all probability have been accepted, had not the
decision been made in the usual preconcerted underhand manner.
Following the columnar idea of Mr. Railton, our talented pupil had
put forth a peculiarly appropriate idea: the shaft would have been
formed by a sea-telescope of gigantic proportions, pulled out to
its utmost extent. On the summit of this Nelson would have been
seated, as on the maintop, smoking his pipe, from which real smoke
would have issued. This would have been produced by a stove at the
bottom of the column, whose object was to furnish a steady supply
of baked potatoes, uninfluenced by the fluctuations of the market,
to the cabmen of Trafalgar-square, and the street-sweepers at
Charing-cross. The artist who designed the elegant structure at
King&rsquo;s-cross, which partakes so comprehensively of the
attributes of a pump, a watch-house, a lamp-post, and a turnpike,
would have superintended its erection, and a carved figure-head
might have been purchased, for a mere song, to crown the elevation.
It would not have much mattered whether the image was intended for
Nelson or not, because, from its extreme elevation, no one, without
a spy-glass, could have told one character from
another&mdash;Thiers from Lord John Russell, George Steevens from
Shakspere, Muntz from the Duke of Brunswick, or anybody else.</p>
<h4>THE MUSEUM.</h4>
<p>The museum of the institution has been gradually increasing in
valuable additions, and donations are respectfully requested from
families having any dust-collecting articles about their houses
which they are anxious to get rid of.</p>
<p>The first curiosities presented were, of course, those which
have formed the nucleus of every museum that was ever established,
and consisted of &ldquo;South Sea Islander&rsquo;s paddles and
spears, North American mocassins and tomahawks, and Sandwich (not
in Kent, but in the Pacific Ocean) canoes and fishing-tackle. In
addition, we have received the following, which the society beg to
acknowledge:&mdash;</p>
<p>The jaw-bone of an animal, supposed to be a cow, found two feet
below the surface, in digging for the Great Western Railway, near
Slough.</p>
<p>Farthing, penny, and sixpence, of the reign of George the
Fourth.</p>
<p>Piece of wood from the red-funnel steam-boat sunk off the Isle
of Dogs, in August, 1841, which had been under water nearly six
days.</p>
<p>A variety of articles manufactured from the above, sufficient to
build a boat twelve times the size, may be purchased of the
librarian.</p>
<p>A floor-tile, in excellent preservation, from the old
Hookham-cum-Snivey workhouse kitchen, before the new union was
built.</p>
<p>Specimens of pebbles collected from the gravel-pits at Highgate,
and a valuable series of oyster-shells, discovered the day after
Bartholomew-fair, near the corner of Cock-lane.</p>
<p>A small lizard, caught in the Regent&rsquo;s-park, preserved in
gin-and-water, in a soda-water bottle, and denominated by the
librarian &ldquo;a heffut.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>LIBRARY.</h4>
<p>Advertisement half of a <em>Times</em> newspaper for March,
1838.</p>
<p>Playbill of the English Opera during Balfe&rsquo;s management,
supposed to be that of the memorable night when 16<em>l.</em>
4<em>s.</em> was taken, in hard cash, at the doors.</p>
<p>View of the Execution of the late Mr. Greenacre in front of
Newgate, published by Catnach, from a drawing by an unknown artist.
(<em>Very rare!</em>)</p>
<p>MS. pantomime, refused at the Haymarket, entitled
&ldquo;Harlequin and the Hungarian Daughter; or, All My Eye and
Betty Martinuzzi,&rdquo; with the whole of the songs, choruses, and
incidental combats and situations. Presented by the author, in
company with a receipt for red and green fire.</p>
<p>Bound copy of Sermons preached at Hookham-cum-Snivey Church, by
the Reverend Peter Twaddle, on the occasions, of building a
dusthole for the national schools; of outfitting the missionaries
who are exported annually to be eaten by the Catawampous Indians;
on the death of Mr. Grubly, the retired cheesemonger, who endowed
the weathercock; and in aid of the funds of the
&ldquo;newly-born-baby-clothes-bag-and-basket-institution:&rdquo;
printed at the desire of his, &ldquo;he fears, in this instance,
too partial&rdquo; parishioners, and presented by himself.</p>
<hr />
<h3>OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.</h3>
<p>The treaty of the four powers, to which Chelsea, Battersea,
Brompton, and Wandsworth are parties, and from which Pimlico has
hitherto obstinately stood aloof, has at length been ratified by
the re-entry of that impetuous suburb into the general views of
Middlesex. We have now a right to call upon Pimlico to disarm, and
to cut off its extra watchman with a promptitude that shall show
the sincerity with which it has joined the neighbouring powers in
the celebrated treaty of Kensington. It is already known that, by
this document, Moses Hayley is recognised as hereditary beadle, and
Abraham Parker is placed in undisturbed possession of the post of
waterman on the coach-stand in the outskirts. We are not among
those who expect to find a spirit of propagandism prevailing in the
policy of the powers of Pimlico. The lamplighter who lights the
district is a man of sound discernment, and there is everything to
hope from the moderation he has always exhibited.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SIBTHORP ON THE CORN LAW.</h3>
<p>Sibthorp came out in full fig at Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s dinner.
While he was having his hair curled, and the irons were heating, he
asked the two-penny operator what was his opinion of the corn-law
question. The barber&rsquo;s answer suggested the following
con.:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why am I like a man eating a particular sort of fancy
bread?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered the tonsor,
&ldquo;you are having</p>

<p>A TWOPENNY TWIST&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This reply made the Colonel&rsquo;s hair stand on end, taking it
quite out of curl.</p>
<hr />
<h3>FISH SAUCE.</h3>
<p>The boy Jones, in one of his visits to the Palace, to avoid
detection, secreted himself up the kitchen chimney. The intense
heat necessary for the preparation of a large dish of white-bait
for her Majesty&rsquo;s dinner compelled him to relax his hold, and
in an instant he was precipitated among the Blackwall delicacies.
The indignant cook immediately demanded &ldquo;his business
there.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; observed the
younker, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S INFORMATION FOR THE PEOPLE.</h2>
<h3>NO. 4.</h3>
<h4>NATURAL HISTORY.</h4>
<p><em>Definition.</em>&mdash;The history of
&ldquo;naturals&rdquo;&mdash;which chiefly include the human
species&mdash;and of &ldquo;simples&rdquo; (herbs), occupies the
branch of science we are about to enlighten our readers upon. It
treats, in fact, of animated nature; while physical
history&mdash;instead of being the history of Apothecaries&rsquo;
Hall, as many suppose&mdash;deals exclusively with inanimate
matter.</p>
<p><em>Of genus, species, and orders.</em>&mdash;If, in the
vegetable world, we commence with the buttercup, and trace all the
various kinds and sizes of plants that exist, up to the pine
(Norwegian), and down again to the hautboy (Cormack&rsquo;s
Princesses); if, among the lower animals, we begin with a gnat and
go up to an elephant, or select from the human species a Lord John
Russell, and place him beside a professor Whewell, we shall see
that nature provides an endless variety of all sorts of everything.
Now, to render a knowledge of everything in natural history as
difficult of acquirement as possible to everybody, the scientific
world divides nature into the above-mentioned classes, to which
Latin names are given. For instance, it would be vulgarly
ridiculous to call a &ldquo;cat&rdquo; by its right name; and when
one says &ldquo;cat,&rdquo; a dogmatic naturalist is justified in
thinking one means a lion or tiger, both these belonging to the
<em>cat</em>egory of &ldquo;cats;&rdquo; hence, a &ldquo;cat&rdquo;
is denominated, for shortness, <em>felis &AElig;gyptiacus;</em> an
ass is turned into a horse, by being an <em>equus</em>; a woman
into a man, for with him she is equally <em>homo</em>.</p>
<p>Of this last species it is our purpose exclusively to treat. The
variety of it we commence with is,</p>
<h4>THE BARBER (<em>homo
emollientissimus</em>.&mdash;TRUEFIT).</h4>
<p><em>Physical structure and peculiarities</em>.&mdash;The most
singular peculiarity of the barber is, that although, in his
avocations, he always is what is termed a &ldquo;strapper,&rdquo;
yet his stature is usually short. His tongue, however, makes up for
this deficiency, being remarkably long,&mdash;a beautiful provision
of nature; for while he is seldom called upon to use his legs with
rapidity, his lingual organ is always obliged to be on the
&ldquo;run.&rdquo; His eyes are keen, and his wits sharp; his mouth
is tinged with humour, and his hair&mdash;particularly when
threatening to be gray&mdash;with <em>poudre unique</em>. Manner,
prepossessing; crop, close; fingers, dirty; toes, turned out. He
seldom indulges in whiskers, for his business is to shave.</p>
<p>1. <em>Habits, reproduction, and food.</em>&mdash;A singular
uniformity of <em>habits</em> is observable amongst barbers. They
all live in shops curiously adorned with play-bills and
pomatum-pots, and use the same formulary of conversation to every
new customer. All are politicians on both sides of every subject;
and if there happen to be three sides to a question, they take a
triangular view of it.</p>
<p>2. <em>Reproduction.</em>&mdash;Some men are born barbers,
others have barberism thrust upon them. The first class are brought
forth in but small numbers, for shavers seldom pair. The second
take to the razor from disappointment in trade or in love. This is
evident, from the habits of the animal when alone, at which period,
if observed, a deep, mysterious, melo-dramatic gloom will be seen
to overspread his countenance. He is essentially a social being;
company is as necessary to his existence as beards.</p>
<p>3. <em>Food.</em>&mdash;Upon this subject the most minute
researches of the most prying naturalists have not been able to
procure a crumb of information. That the barber does eat can only
be inferred; it cannot be proved, for no person was ever known to
catch him in the act; if he does masticate, he munches in silence
and in secret<sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1. Not so of
drinking. Only last week we saw, with our own eyes, a pot of ale in
a barber&rsquo;s shop; and very good ale it was, too, for we tasted
it.</span>.</p>
<p><em>Geographical distribution of barbers.</em>&mdash;Although
the majority of barbers live near the <em>pole</em>, they are
pretty diffusely disseminated over the entire face of the globe.
The advance of civilization has, however, much lessened their
numbers; for we find, wherever valets are kept, barbers are not;
and as the magnet turns towards the north, they are attracted to
the east. In St. James&rsquo;s, the shaver&rsquo;s
&ldquo;occupation&rsquo;s gone;&rdquo; but throughout the whole of
Wapping, the distance is very short</p>

<p>&ldquo;FROM POLE TO POLE.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A LECTURE ON MORALITY.&mdash;BY PUNCH.</h2>
<p>Moral philosophers are the greatest fools in the world. I am a
moral philosopher; I am no fool though. Who contradicts me? If any,
speak, and come within reach of my cudgel. I am a moral philosopher
of a new school. The schoolmaster is abroad, and I am the
schoolmaster; but if anybody says that <em>I</em> am abroad, I will
knock him down. I am <em>at home</em>. And now, good people, attend
to me, and you will hear something worth learning.</p>
<p>The reason why I call all moral philosophers fools is, because
they have not gone properly to work. Each has given his own
peculiar notions, merely, to the world. Now, different people have
different opinions: some like apples, and others prefer another
sort of fruit, with which, no doubt, many of you are familiar.
&ldquo;Who shall decide when doctors disagree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My system of morality is the result of induction. I am very fond
of Bacon&mdash;I mean, the Bacon recommended to you by the
&ldquo;Society for the Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Lord</em> Bacon. I therefore study the
actions of mankind, and draw my inferences accordingly. The people
whose conduct I attend to are those who get on best in the world;
for the object of all morality is to make ourselves happy, and as
long as we are so, what, my good friends, does it signify?</p>
<p>The first thing that you must do in the study of morals is, to
get rid of all prejudices. Bacon and I quite agree upon this point.
By prejudices I mean your previous notions concerning right and
wrong.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson calls morality &ldquo;the doctrine of the duties of
life.&rdquo; In this definition I agree. The doctor was a clever
man. I very much admire the knock-down arguments that he was so
fond of; it is the way in which I usually reason myself. Now the
duties of life are two-fold&mdash;our duty to others and our duty
to ourselves. Our duty to ourselves is to make ourselves as
comfortable as possible; our duty to others, is to make them assist
us to the best of their ability in so doing. This is the plan on
which all respectable persons act, and it is one which I have
always followed myself. What are the consequences? See how popular
I am; and, what is more, observe how fat I have got! Here is a
corporation for you! Here is a leg! What think you of such a cap as
this? and of this embroidered coat? Who says that I am not a fine
fellow, and that my system is not almost as fine? Let him argue the
point with me, if he dare!</p>
<p>Happiness consists in pursuing our inclinations without
disturbance, and without getting into trouble. Make it, then, your
first rule of conduct always to do exactly as you please; that is,
if you can. I am not like other moralists, who talk in one way and
act in another. What I advise you to do, is nothing more than what
I practise myself, as you have very often observed, I dare say.</p>
<p>Be careful to show, invariably, a proper respect for the laws;
that is to say, when you do anything illegal, take all the
precautions that you can against being found out. Here, perhaps, my
example is somewhat at variance with my doctrine; but I am
stronger, you know, than the executive, and therefore, instead of
my respecting it, it ought to respect me.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep a quiet conscience. In order that you may secure
this greatest of blessings, never allow yourselves to regret any
part of your past behaviour; and whenever you feel tempted to do
so, take the readiest means that you can think of to banish
reflection, or, as Lord Byron very properly terms it&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The blight of life, the demon Thought!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You have observed that, after having knocked anybody on the
head, I generally begin to dance and sing. This I do, not because I
am troubled with any such weakness as remorse, but in order to
instruct you. I do not mean to say that you are to conduct
yourselves precisely in the same manner under similar
circumstances; a pipe, or a pot, or a pinch of snuff&mdash;in
short, any means of diversion&mdash;will answer your purpose
equally well.</p>
<p>Adhere strictly to truth&mdash;whenever there is no occasion for
lying. Be particularly careful to conceal no one circumstance
likely to redound to your credit. But when two principles clash,
the weaker, my good people, must, as the saying is, go to the wall.
If, therefore, it be to your interest to lie, do so, and do it
boldly. No one would wear false hair who had hair of his own; but
he who has none, must, of course, wear a wig. I do not see any
difference between false hair and false assertions; and I think a
lie a very useful invention. It is like a coat or a pair of
breeches, it serves to clothe the naked. But do not throw your
falsifications away: I like a proper economy. Some silly persons
would have you invariably speak the truth. My friends, if you were
to act in this way, in what department of commerce could you
succeed? How could you get on in the law? what vagabond would ever
employ you to defend his cause? What practice do you think you
would be likely to procure as a physician, if you were to tell
every old woman who fancied herself ill, that there was nothing the
matter with her, or to prescribe abstinence to an alderman, as a
cure for indigestion? What would be your prospect in the church,
where, not to mention a few other little trifles, you would have,
when you came to be made a bishop, to say that you did not wish to
be any such thing? No, my friends, truth is all very well when the
telling of it is convenient; but when it is not, give me a bouncing
lie. But that one lie, object the advocates of uniform veracity,
will require twenty more to make it good: very well, then, tell
them. Ever have a due regard to the sanctity of oaths; this you
will evince by never using them to support a fiction, except on
high and solemn occasions, such as when you are about to be
invested with some public dignity. But avoid any approach to a
superstitious veneration for them: it is to keep those thin-skinned
and impracticable individuals who are infected by this failing from
the management of public affairs, that they have been, in great
measure, devised.</p>
<p>Never break a promise, unless bound to do so by a previous one;
and promise yourselves from this time forth never to do anything
that will put you to inconvenience.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>[pg
120]</span>
<p>Never take what does not belong to you. For, as a young pupil
who formerly attended these lectures pathetically expressed
himself, he furnishing, at the time, in his own person, an
illustration of the maxim&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Him as prigs wot isn&rsquo;t his&rsquo;n,</p>
<p>Ven &rsquo;a&rsquo;s cotch must go to pris&rsquo;n!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But what is it that does <em>not</em> belong to you? I answer,
whatever you cannot take with impunity. Never fail, however, to
appropriate that which the law does not protect. This is a duty
which you owe to yourselves. And in order that you may thoroughly
carry out this principle, procure, if you can, a legal education;
because there are a great many flaws in titles, agreements, and the
like, the knowledge of which will often enable you to lay hands
upon various kinds of property to which at first sight you might
appear to have no claim. Should you ever be so circumstanced as to
be beyond the control of the law, you will, of course, be able to
take whatever you want; because there will be nothing then that
will <em>not</em> belong to you. This, my friends, is a grand moral
principle; and, as illustrative of it, we have an example (as
schoolboys say in their themes) in Alexander the Great; and
besides, in all other conquerors that have ever lived, from Nimrod
down to Napoleon inclusive.</p>
<p>Speak evil of no one behind his back, unless you are likely to
get anything by so doing. On the contrary, have a good word to say,
if you can, of everybody, provided that the person who is praised
by you is likely to be informed of the circumstance. And, the more
to display the generosity of your disposition, never hesitate, on
convenient occasions, to bestow the highest eulogies on those who
do not deserve them.</p>
<p>Be abstemious&mdash;in eating and drinking at your own expense;
but when you feed at another person&rsquo;s, consume as much as you
can possibly digest.</p>
<p>Let your behaviour be always distinguished by modesty. Never
boast or brag, when you are likely to be disbelieved; and do not
contradict your superiors&mdash;that is to say, when you are in the
presence of people who are richer than yourselves, never express an
opinion of your own.</p>
<p>Live peaceably with all mankind, if you can; but, as you cannot,
endeavor, as the next best thing, to settle all disputes as
speedily as possible, by coming, without loss of time, to blows;
provided always that the debate promises to be terminated, by
reason of your superior strength, in your own favour, and that you
are not likely to be taken up for knocking another person down. It
is very true that I, individually, <em>never</em> shun this kind of
discussion, whatever may be the strength and pretensions of my
opponent; but then, I enjoy a consciousness of superiority over the
whole world, which you, perhaps, may not feel, and which might, in
some cases, mislead you. I think, however, that a supreme contempt
for all but yourselves is a very proper sentiment to entertain;
and, from what I observe of the conduct of certain teachers, I
imagine that this is what is meant by the word humility. You must,
nevertheless, be careful how you display it; do so only when you
see a probability of overawing and frightening those around you, so
as to make them contributors to the great aim of your
existence&mdash;self-gratification.</p>
<p>Be firm, but not obstinate. Never change your mind when the
result of the alteration would be detrimental to your comfort and
interest; but do not maintain an inconvenient inflexibility of
purpose. Do not, for instance, in affairs of the heart, simply
because you have declared, perhaps with an oath or two, that you
will be constant till death, think it necessary to make any effort
to remain so. The case stands thus: you enter into an agreement
with a being whose aggregate of perfections is expressible, we will
say, by 20. Now, if they would always keep at that point, there
might be some reason for your remaining unaltered, namely, your not
being able to help it. But suppose that they dwindle down to
19-1/2, the person, that is, the whole sum of the qualities
admired, no longer exists, and you, of course, are absolved from
your engagement. But mind, I do not say that you are justified in
changing <em>only</em> in case of a change on the opposite side:
you may very possibly become simply tired. In this case, your prior
promise to yourself will absolve you from the performance of the
one in question.</p>
<p>And now, my good friends, before we part, let me beg of you not
to allow yourselves to be diverted from the right path by a parcel
of cant. You will hear my system stigmatised as selfish; and I
advise you, whenever you have occasion to speak of it in general
society, to call it so too. You will thus obtain a character for
generosity; a very desirable thing to have, if you can get it
cheap. Selfish, indeed! is not self the axis of the earth out of
which you were taken? The fact is, good people, that just as
notions the very opposite of truth have prevailed in matters of
science, so have they, likewise, in those of morals. A set of
impracticable doctrines, under the name of virtue, have been
preached up by your teachers; and it is only fortunate that they
have been practised by so few; those few having been, almost to a
man, poisoned, strangled, burnt, or worse treated, for their
pains.</p>
<p>But here comes the police, to interfere, as usual, with the
dissemination of useful truths. Farewell, my good people; and
whenever you are disposed for additional instruction, I can only
say that I shall be very happy to afford it to you for a reasonable
consideration.</p>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>A BOWER OF BLISS IN STANGATE.</h2>
<p class="note">Oh, fly to the Bower&mdash;fly with me.&mdash;OLD
OR NEW SONG (<em>I forget which</em>).</p>
<p>If you take a walk over Waterloo-bridge, and, after going
straight on for some distance, turn to the right, you will find
yourself in the New-Cut, where you may purchase everything, from a
secretaire-bookcase to a saveloy, on the most moderate terms
possible. The tradesmen of the New-Cut are a peculiar class, and
the butchers, in particular, seem to be brimming over with the milk
of human kindness, for every female customer is addressed as
&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; while every male passer-by is saluted with
the friendly greeting of &ldquo;Now, old chap, what can I do for
you?&rdquo; The greengrocers in this &ldquo;happy land&rdquo;
earnestly invite the ladies to &ldquo;pull away&rdquo; at the
mountains of cabbages which their sheds display, while little boys
on the pavement offer what they playfully designate &ldquo;a plummy
ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth,&rdquo; of onions to the casual
passenger.</p>
<p>At the end of the New-Cut stands the Marsh-gate, which, at
night, is all gas and ghastliness, dirt and dazzle, blackguardism
and brilliancy. The illumination of the adjacent gin-palace throws
a glare on the haggard faces of those who are sauntering outside.
Having arrived thus far, watch your opportunity, by dodging the
cabs and threading the maze of omnibuses, to effect a crossing,
when you will find Stangate-street, <em>running out</em>, as some
people say, of the Westminster-road; though of the fact that a
street ever ran out of a road, we take leave to be sceptical.</p>
<p>Well, go on down this Stangate-street, and when you get to the
bottom, you will find, on the left-hand, THE BOWER! And a pretty
bower it is, not of leaves and flowers, but of bricks and mortar.
It is not</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;A bower of roses by Bendermere&rsquo;s stream,</p>
<p class="i2">With the nightingale singing there all the day
long;</p>
<p>In the days of my childhood &rsquo;twas like a sweet dream,</p>
<p class="i2">To sit &rsquo;mid the roses and hear the birds&rsquo;
song.</p>
<p>That bower, and its music, I never forget:</p>
<p class="i2">But oft, when alone, at the close of the year,</p>
<p>I think is the nightingale singing there yet,</p>
<p class="i2">Are the roses still fresh by the calm
Bendermere?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>No, there is none of this sentimental twaddle about the Bower to
which we are alluding. There are no roses, and no nightingale; but
there are lots of smoking, and plenty of vocalists. We will
paraphrase Moore, since we can hardly do less, and we may say, with
truth,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Bower in Stangate&rsquo;s respectable
street,</p>
<p class="i2">There&rsquo;s a company acting there all the night
long;</p>
<p>In the days of my childhood, egad&mdash;what a treat!</p>
<p class="i2">To listen attentive to some thundering song.</p>
<p>That Bower and its concert I never forget;</p>
<p class="i2">But oft when of halfpence my pockets are clear,</p>
<p>I think, are the audience sitting there yet,</p>
<p class="i2">Still smoking their pipes, and imbibing their
beer?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Upon entering the door, you are called on to pay your money,
which is threepence for the saloon and sixpence for the boxes. The
saloon is a large space fitted up something like a chapel, or
rather a court of justice; there being in front of each seat a
species of desk or ledge, which, in the places last named would
hold prayer-books or papers, but at the Bower are designed for
tumblers and pewter-pots. The audience, like the spirits they
imbibe, are very much mixed; the greater portion consisting of
respectable mechanics, while here and there may be seen an
individual, who, from his seedy coat, well-brushed four-and-nine
hat, highly polished but palpably patched highlows, outrageously
shaved face and absence of shirt collar, is decidedly an amateur,
who now and then plays a part, and as he is never mistaken for an
actor on the stage, tries when off to look as much like one as
possible.</p>
<p>The boxes are nothing but a gallery, and are generally visited
by a certain class of ladies who resemble angels, at least, in one
particular, for they are &ldquo;few and far between.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what are the entertainments? A miscellaneous concert, in
which the first tenor, habited in a <em>surtout</em>, with the
tails pinned back, to look like a dress-coat, apostrophises his
&ldquo;pretty Jane,&rdquo; and begs particularly to know her reason
for looking so <em>sheyi</em>&mdash;<em>vulgo</em>, shy. Then there
is the bass, who disdains any attempt at a body-coat, but honestly
comes forward in a decided bearskin, and, while going down to G,
protests emphatically that &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the C (sea).&rdquo;
Then there is the <em>prima donna</em>, in a pink gauze petticoat,
over a yellow calico slip, with lots of jewels (sham), an immense
colour in the very middle of the cheek, but terribly chalked just
about the mouth, and shouting the &ldquo;Soldier tired,&rdquo; with
a most insinuating simper at the corporal of the Foot-guards in
front, who returns the compliment by a most outrageous leer between
each whiff of his tobacco-pipe.</p>
<p>Then comes an <em>Overture by the band</em>, which is a little
commonwealth, in which none aspires to lead, none condescends to
follow. At it they go indiscriminately, and those who get first to
the end of the composition, strike in at the point where the others
happen to have arrived; so that, if they proceed at sixes and
sevens, they generally contrive to end in unison.</p>
<p>Occasionally we are treated with Musard&rsquo;s <em>Echo
quadrilles</em>, when the solos are all done by the octave flute,
so are all the echoes, and so is everything but the
<em>cada</em>.</p>
<p>But the grand performance of the night is the dramatic piece,
which is generally a three-act opera, embracing the whole debility
of the company. There is the villain, who always looks so wretched
as to impress on the mind that, if honesty is not the best policy,
rascality is certainly the worst. Then there is the lover, whose
woe-begone countenance and unhappy gait, render it really
surprising that the heroine, in dirty white sarsnet, should have
displayed so much constancy. The low comedy is generally done by a
gentleman who, while fully impressed with the importance of the
&ldquo;low,&rdquo; seems wholly to overlook the
&ldquo;comedy;&rdquo; and there is now and then a banished
nobleman, who appears to have entirely forgotten everything in the
shape of nobility during his banishment. There is not unfrequently
a display of one of the proprietor&rsquo;s children in a part
requiring &ldquo;infant innocence;&rdquo; and as our ideas of that
angelic state are associated principally with pudding heads and
dirty faces, the performance is generally got through with a
nastiness approaching to nicety. But it is time to make our escape
from the <em>Bower</em>, and we therefore leave them to get through
the &ldquo;Chough and Crow&rdquo;&mdash;which is often the wind-up,
because it admits of a good deal of growling&mdash;in our absence.
We cannot be tempted to remain even to witness the pleasing
performances of the &ldquo;Sons of Syria,&rdquo; nor the
&ldquo;Aunts of Abyssinia.&rdquo; We will not wait to see Mr.
Macdonald sing &ldquo;Hot codlings&rdquo; on his head, though the
bills inform us he has been honoured by a command to go through
that interesting process from &ldquo;<em>nearly all the crowned
heads in Europe</em>.&rdquo;</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
